2 February, 2014 - Version 1.0
	We've changed a lot today!
		- Passing by value is dumb, so we've now changed to passing by pointer.
		- Finally got the matrix initializer reasonable (now you pass a string)
		- Changed the wrapper program's name to maw
		- Made the wrapper program MUCH better.
	That's all the important stuff. This is a new version, meaning it will completely break old code.
	Also, Version 1.0! I feel like this is ready enough to be called v1. I'll change it to 1.5 if I ever get the inverse of bigger matrices down.
	Finally, GO HAWKS!
